# Birbal
## A project for the Mumbai Hackathon 2022

Birbal is a platform with which we aim to bridge the communication gap between the common man and their elected representatives.

With Birbal, we aim to provide a dedicated platform where people can freely share the problems faced by them in their day-to-day lives with their local leaders.

## Features

Users have to join respective communities representing their wards/zones.

Then users can add issues on their respective pages and promote/demote issues that are already posted.

The local representative will be the head of the given community and will be able to see all the issues and also mark/edit them as 'solved'.

Along with being a platform to increase communication between common people and local leaders, Birbal will also hold records of all the issues that were posted on any given page and show a summary of the number of issues solved and pending.
